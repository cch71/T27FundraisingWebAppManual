If you have an issue with the Fundraising system try these steps.

1. Try refreshing your browser.
2. Try logging off and back on.
3. If none of those fix the problem then you can let the developer know by using
   the _Report Issue_ menu item.

If you have an idea of how to make this system better please feel free to use
this _Report Issue_ method to make the request.
