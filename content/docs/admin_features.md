#### Adding Users

To add users to the system create a spreadsheet with the following headers/rows

| last_name | first_name | group | uid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| James | Kirk | Apache | jkirk |

The _uid_ is optional and will be autogenerated if not provided.
The system will detect duplicate names and will autogenerate if a duplicate is
found.

{{< figure src="/images/admin/AdminUploadUsers.png" >}}

After selecting the file to upload click the __Submit__ button to upload the file.

__This will kick off a currently rather overcomplicated process.__

1. Uploading the list will register the users into the system.
   - Their login will not yet be created but will be visible for
      spreading / timecard entry
2. The upload process generates a GitHub issue where the app admin runs a script
   that will create user logins.
3. The password information is stored in a secure location that will be shared
   with the fundraising coordinator.
4. The fundraising coordinator will provide the login information to the seller.

#### User Edit

The only editable field here is the __Group__ input.  The seller can be moved
to a different group at any time.  This is a free form field and so be careful
with spelling.

  delivery point for a specific delivery day.

In addition to these extra reports, where applicable, there is an additional
dropdown on these, as well as the other reports, to filter by a specific seller
or a special _Show All Users_ seller that will give a report for all sellers.

## Fundraiser Closeout

To closeout the Fundraiser the following requirements should be met:

- Have all the money received deposited in the bank

   2025 where additional troop expenses where taken out._
